# 3Dchess
An app to play three-dimensional chess on tabletop or against the computer

## What I did
- Researched different historical interpretations of 3D chess to decide on how my game would work
- Coded game and user interface in Python with Pygame
- Created and finetuned a minimax AI
- Wrote a project summary to submit for "Head's prize" research competition

## The project in motion
